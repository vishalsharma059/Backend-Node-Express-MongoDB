how to handle backend process of forms and making sure data coming from any frontend lib, fw, templating engines, we still handle it at the backend 

okh so we have send the plain text but the server recieved the blob which us not directly readable 

app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({extender: true}));

these both are used to read the plain text that we send with the help of form through frontend
